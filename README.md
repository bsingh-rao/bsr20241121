##### **About me**

I am naturally curious and blessed with a learning mindset – qualities that keep me engaged, exploring, and discovering new technologies. Despite years of experience, I firmly believe there is always more to learn, and I take pride in my ability to listen with an open mind.

For over 12 years, I have specialized in marketing automation, mastering Adobe Marketo Engage. Along this journey, I’ve earned recognition as a **6x Adobe Marketo Engage Business Practitioner Expert** and a **3x Adobe Marketo Engage Champion (2023–2026)**. My passion extends beyond implementation – I actively share insights through **LinkedIn carousels, YouTube, Marketo Nation Community (Experience League), and Marketo Engage User Groups**. I also co-lead the **Chandigarh Tricity Marketo User Group Chapter** alongside Ruchi Lapran, Vinay Pathania, and Amit Jain, building a vibrant hub for collaboration and knowledge exchange.

But my journey doesn’t stop with Marketo. I am deeply invested in experimenting with **AI-enabled technologies** and exploring how they can transform marketing automation. I am [learning API integrations](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marketingoperations_how-to-study-apis-using-marketo-use-balkar-activity-7238773123909607424-kyKI/), earned my [**Level 1 badge for n8n**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marketingoperations_n8n-json-automation-activity-7357858864995717121-h4Mb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA0cco0BN0BzzjgugRrgrkln079ihlYTyng), and am currently diving into **creating [AI agents with Marketo](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marketingoperations_adobemarketoengage-agenticai-skillexchange-activity-7363992909508927488-NoP7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA0cco0BN0BzzjgugRrgrkln079ihlYTyng)** under the guidance of industry experts. I also share forward-looking ideas, such as ways to [identify website traffic originating from tools like ChatGPT](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marketingoperations_this-seems-like-a-good-way-to-assess-traffic-activity-7371942242774794240-rS74?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA0cco0BN0BzzjgugRrgrkln079ihlYTyng). My passion in automation led me to create an [automation system to water my plants](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marketingoperations_ai-is-more-than-digital-orchestration-is-activity-7374714125433671680-cchO?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA0cco0BN0BzzjgugRrgrkln079ihlYTyng) as a hobby project.

Today, I balance two tracks – continuing **hands-on practice with Marketo** while simultaneously **studying emerging AI technologies**. At the intersection of marketing automation and artificial intelligence, I see endless possibilities, and I am determined to stay at the forefront of this evolution.

##### **Work Experience**

I am working as a Marketing Manager at HERE Technologies since 2023\. Most of my projects are about solving marketing automation problems. Some of them are about campaign designs, and messaging. I have been working for documentation and clarification of complex systems in place, technical assistance in integration projects, database optimization, formulating reports for analytics, and analyzing improvement opportunities.

Example projects

▪ Investigating sales queries about why certain leads were assigned (or not) by Marketo  
▪ Researching feasibility of technical and complex requirements for various initiatives  
▪ Providing technical assistance – e.g. integration projects which involve Marketo  
▪ Maintaining database quality and keeping it within threshold  
▪ Impact assessment/QA in various projects with peer reviews, or scenario testing  
▪ Marketing ideas for nurture designs & messaging

I have been solving marketing automation problems using Adobe Marketo Engage since 2013\. My commitment to stick with Marketo gave me a diverse experience of working with 100+ Marketo customers at Grazitti Interactive (2013-2023)

I learnt about customer problems, service delivery processes, team management, sales support and more aspects of work – aimed to deliver high quality work and sustain customer satisfaction. I am now transitioning into a role of marketing while maintaining my forte in automation. My strength is awareness of technical feasibilities. This combination brings unique value to organization – I don’t always need to check technical feasibility for marketing ideas – although I acknowledge a technical possibility doesn’t automatically translate to application in business. Learning a lot along the way.

I admire the team at HERE Technologies, however I am always open to discuss opportunities. You can [download my Resume here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dgm7XI3DFA9Z8tgLvf7_Ald9mSysPab8/view?usp=sharing).

##### **Community and participation**

During my early years, I learnt a lot from Marketo Community. And I am grateful to be a part of Adobe Championship Program.

I share my learnings from Marketo at:

▪ LinkedIn (Carousels and Posts)  
▪ YouTube (Solo talks about concepts)  
▪ Marketo Nation Community (Champion Blogs)  
▪ Marketo User Groups (Deep Dives)

Besides, I also co-lead the Chandigarh Tricity Chapter for the Marketo User Groups where we host virtual discussions about various Marketo topics. Past recordings of the topics can be found on the Adobe’s official YouTube channel for Marketo user groups.
